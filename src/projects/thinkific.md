    <p>It wasn't until we started talking to customers that we recognized how different each use case for Groups was. After extensive user research and iteration we designed User Groups to give every Thinkific school a better way to organize existing students and sell to new ones.</p>

    <p>We redesigned the Thinkific main navigation to be friendlier, more powerful for everyone, and include global search. With such a diverse user base we spent a lot of time understanding what people different disliked about the current navigation, how they navigated the app, and what features they used the most in order to understand how we could improve their experience and productivity.</p>
